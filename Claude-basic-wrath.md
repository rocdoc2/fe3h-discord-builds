## Basic wrath Claude

Claude's a unit with solid bases, stupid easy rank benchmarks, battalion wrath, and dibs on the Cichol Wyvern Co. He's not fancy but he's still probably your best unit.
With this build he'll be a solid unit and then become a vantage wrath flyer with very little effort.

__Class Path__ <br>
Fighter -> Brigand/Archer/Merc -> Wyvern rider -> Wyvern Master -> Barbarossa

You can skip brigand if you want, but he wants the axe rank anyway and deathblow can help with some diamond axe one shots. You can also pick up armor knight bases with just E+ heavy armor so feel free to do that.

There's some benefit to going wyvern lord over Claude's unique classes, but it's also more work. Do it if you feel like it.

__Rank Priorities__ <br>
C bows -> D+ Swords -> C axes -> C flying + A authority

Make sure you build authority gradually over part 1. A's the big one, but you still want C by chapter 3 and B by chapter 7 so he can use new battalions as you unlock 
them.

If you feel like going for B+ axes to get wrath from warrior, feel free to do so. 

When you're done with all this just go for bow rank. 

__Skill Loadout__
- battalion wrath
- vantage
- hit +20
- defensive tactics/bow prowess/bow crit +10/strength +2


__Battalion Recommendation__ <br>
Cichol Wyvern co. It's like 70% of why Claude is good.
