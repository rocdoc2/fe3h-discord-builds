__B. vantage Lorenz__

Lorenz boasts the unique trait of being the best caster with access to battalion 
vantage. Tomes are a great weapon type for b. vantage because of its easier ohko's 
and long range. For a normal Lorenz this enables some neat tricks like gambiting 
enemies and then sweeping them up, but there's achievable benchmarks that let him 
just kill everything in one hit instead.

Apart from the stat boosters, this build is more or less the same as what you'd do 
for a normal Lorenz. This page will moreso be a catalogue of midgame benchmarks so 
you know what numbers to boost up to. 

__Stat benchmarks__ <br>
We'll start at chapter 10 because chapter 9 is all demonic beasts and you probably 
won't have level 20 in chapter 8.

Story missions:
- Ch 10: 55 mag atk
- Ch 11: 54 mag atk
- Ch 12: 66 
Chapter 13: N/A. Lorenz will arrive with a full replenished battalion.

Paralogues:
- Ingrid: 55 
- Sylvain: 46
- Lorenz: 54
- Sothis: forget about it
- Felix: 47
- Ignatz: 51
- Ashe: 62*
- Seteth: 64*
- Alois: 51
- Manuela: 57
- Hilda: 62

*these maps have outlier enemies that can be avoided. If you do, the numbers are 
more in line with other maps.

__Usage__
I derived the above benchmarks based on the toughest enemy you can kill on enemy 
phase that  actually threatens Lorenz. Simply being a warlock with Gloucester 
Knights pumps his res above what most magic enemies could mess with. Now I want to 
give some context for those numbers

Warlock Lorenz with Gloucester Knights, magic staff, and Ferdie backpack is 
guaranteed 47 magic attack with sagittae and 55 with ragnarok. That's before rally 
magic. With that in mind sagittae can hit some of those benchmarks for free and 
ragnarok hits most of them. Even an unboosted Lorenz can make an effective sweeper 
at times. You should make use of that.

However, if you want Lorenz to kill every last one of them and be OP as hell, you 
want him to hit all the benchmarks with sagittae. That way he'll kill most of the 
maps without running into ammo problems. With that in mind, +8 magic from boosters 
is the ideal amount. It's just enough for him to beat almost all the mid 50s 
thresholds.


__Class path__
Monk -> Mage/Cavalier -> Warlock/Paladin -> Dark knight

When Lorenz can sweep with b. vantage, warlock gets way better than paladin. 
Even so, it's a good option to have for some maps.

Also, don't give Lorenz the statboosters until he's certified for warlock. 
I assume most readers know what class bases are but I wanted to be careful here 
because it's actually a big deal.

__Rank priorities__

D reason -> D faith -> D authority -> C Reason -> C+ lances -> B+ reason and 
B authority -> C+ riding -> S reason

When these are done consider A authority, A+ riding, C faith and S+ reason. 
If Lorenz sweeps the entire midgame, black tomefaire's pretty doable and helps him 
keep it going in part 2.

__Skill Loadout__
