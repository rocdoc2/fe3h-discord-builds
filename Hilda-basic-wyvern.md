## Basic Wyvern Hilda

Hilda's a simple unit that can do good stuff without much of work. Which is good. She'd be pretty annoyed otherwise. She'll go into good class and have good stats. Hit 
very hard.

This build is easy and pretty bare bones. You can easily tack stuff on like mercenary or fortress knight or flying rank to enable some battalion wrath strats at different
points in the game. 

__Class Path__ <br>
Soldier or fighter -> Archer/Brigand/Pegasus -> Wyvern Rider -> Wyvern Lord

Soldier vs fighter is pure preference. There's several spots where you can repo someone over a wall and it gives them 7+ spaces of movement. I'm a reposition fan but 
strength +2 isn't bad by any means.

Feel free to cert armor knight for the defense base on in house Hilda. Warrior base is about even with her average strength, but it can help. It's a small investment and 
even if you only get +1 strength out of it, it's pretty good.

__Rank Priorities__ <br>
C lances -> E+ flying and D authority -> D+ bows -> C authority -> B axes and D flying -> A axes and C+ flying

You don't have to stop at C authority. The reason people do is that there's a C rank flying battalion on every route that's at least good enough, and you might as well 
give it to Hilda. If you want to get B authority on her it's pretty easy to get. 

When you're done with these, go for A+ or S axes I guess. Like I said earlier, there's easy stuff to get that could make this some kind of wrath build, but I feel like
that would be for a different build guide. 

__Skill Loadout__
- Death Blow
- Hit +20
- Axe prowess
- Darting blow/strength +2/defiant crit/lancebreaker

Darting blow's not as important as you might think. Hilda can often use diamond axe or brave axe to just kill things without getting counterattacked. It for sure has 
its uses though. 

Don't be afraid of diamond axe's hit penalty. Obviously some enemies are too dodgy but you'll still see good hit rates against a lot of them. Especially if she's using
the kingdom wyvern co.
