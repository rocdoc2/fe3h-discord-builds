## Sniper Ignatz

Ignatz doesn't have stats or combat arts. Good thing there's a class that fixes both of those. Once he's mastered sniper he can orko mooks from long range with high 
crit rates. While he gets there, he can make use of his great rally and authority utility.

__Class Path__ <br>
Fighter -> Archer/Brigand -> Sniper

Some people like to dip into hero for defiant strength. I find hunter's volley consistent enough without it, but go ahead if you feel like it. The rank benchmarks for 
it are very low.

__Rank Priorities__ <br>
C authority -> C bows -> D+ axes -> B authority -> B+ bows -> A authority

Rally speed is just so great early. Authority is something Iggy wants to make a lot of use out of. Access to high rank physical battalions as soon as they're available 
helps his stats a lot. 

Just the ability to equip indech sword fighters is a good utility in its own right. Usually your only other physical unit with A authority is the one that really wants
retribution. 

When you're done with these consider A+ or S bows and cav ranks. Sometimes you just want the guy with retribution and rallies to be mounted. S authority for rally 
strength can also be worthwhile, but you can get it for much less on other characters.

__Skill Loadout__
- Death blow
- Hit +20
- Bow prowess
- Strength +2/Bow crit +10/rallies


__Recruitment__<br>
If you give archer Iggy the chapter 3 goddess icon he gets 19 luck instantly which compensates for the wexp he loses not being a fighter by dropping his certification 
benchmarks. He also gets 1.5 points of crit. It's funny, but seriously recruit him as a fighter.
