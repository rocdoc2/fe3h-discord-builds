## Frozen Lance Nuke

Lorenz might not have the best magic stat, but frozen lance (and some of the lances 
you can use it with) is so powerful that even he can blow enemies off the map. An 
unboosted Lorenz can often ohko with just a silver+, nevermind Lance of Ruin of Spear 
of Assal.

__Class Path__ <br>
Monk -> Mage/Cav -> Warlock/Paladin -> Dark Knight

Paladin outclasses dark knight in terms of frozen lance damage and movement, but dark 
knight's healing and long range options are good enough that I still prefer it. 
There's a lot of enemies that can get ohko'd by ragnarok or orko'd fire or sagittae.

Unlike Marianne or Hubert, Lorenz actually does need to cert warlock for the magic
base. It's also good to have for some battalion vantage shenanigans.

__Rank priorities__ <br>

D reason -> D faith -> D authority -> C reason -> C+ Lances -> B+ Reason -> C+ riding 
-> B authority -> B lances

When this is done consider C faith, A and A+ lances, A+ and S reason, A authority, 
and A+ riding.

__Skill loadout__
- Fiendish blow
- mag +2
- Lance prowess/dex +4/Reason prowess/black magic range+1/move +1

__Recruitment__ <br>
OOH Lorenz is weird. If you recruit him as a cav his speed gets hurt a bit, so
you usually recruit him as a soldier just to avoid that. The strength and
bulk cav gives him isn't nothing though. If Lorenz is just going to be a filler
horse for striding he should definitely be recruiting in chapter 6 or 7.
