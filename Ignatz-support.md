## Full Support Iggy

This is a build to give you an indech sword fighters/blue lion dancers/rally bot for minimum effort. It also gives Iggy the one other thing he wants for that: mobility.

__Class Path__ <br>
Soldier -> Cav/Thief -> Paladin/Assassin

Soldier is for repo but its unnecessary. Thief and assassin have a good movement type on the maps where horses don't and they're easy to access. They're also not 
necessary. Monk certification might actually help for a desert map and its basically free so grab that too if you feel like it. True minimum effort would keep him in Cav
all game.

Hitting level 20 with this type of build isn't a given because none of the actions you deploy Iggy for give xp. If you do feed him enough the +1 move is worth it.

You could also consider wyvern rider. This usually costs his supportive gambit but a flying rally bot is good for some maps.

__Rank Priorities__ <br>
D+ lances and D riding -> A authority -> C swords -> C bows -> S authority -> C+ lances and C+ riding

__Skill Loadout__
- Rally speed
- Rally strength
- Rally dex

The other skills aren't going to matter. Prowess ig?
