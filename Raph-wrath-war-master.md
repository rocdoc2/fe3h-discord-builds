## Wrath War Master

Raph's very underrated. His Bartre speed growth puts off a lot of players, but the combination weight -3, speed meals, and class bases almost entirely fix it. 
What you're left with is an overgrown gorilla with a good rally, good boons, and one of the best skills in the game in battalion wrath. Here's a build path that fixes his
problems while he transitions into a wrath abusing monster. 

__Class path__ <br>
Fighter -> Brigand/Archer/Merc -> Wyvern rider/Fortress knight/Warrior -> War Master

Thief bases are only 1 speed over merc bases, but it can still help. Get them if you have a spare seal. He'll also usually benefit from armor knight bases and gets the 
ranks for free, so cert for that as well if you can.

__Rank priorities__ <br>
D authority + C heavy armor -> D+ swords -> C Axes -> D+ bows -> B+ axes + D flying -> B authority -> C+ or B brawling (depends on luck stat)

When you're done with all that, consider A+ or S axes, B heavy armor, wyvern lord ranks, and A authority.

Feel free to skip warrior and put off B+ axes. Getting normal wrath can be nice but isn't at all required. It's a fine class for him to have because it goes well with the
wrath stuff and allows grounded battalions, but it's completely skippable.

__Skill loadout__
- battalion wrath/wrath
- vantage
- hit +20
- axe prowess
- defensive tactics/axe crit +10/lancebreaker/deathblow

Keep in mind that in the midgame (chapters 8-12) you don't necessarily need vantage or perfect hit and crit if you just stack enough prt that you barely take damage. 
Either Wyvern rider or fortress knight can do this periodically.

__Battalion Recommendations__ <br>
Leicester mercs or Goneril Valks. Cichol Wyvern Co and Indech Swordfighters are also good if he gets access to them. For a vantage wrath build it's very important he 
doesn't miss and achieves 100% crit chance.

__Recruitment__<br>
Recruiting Raph as a fighter gives a huge chunk of bow rank. However, brawler Raph has much better bases. Generally, I think there's plenty of time to get bow rank to have hit +20 when you want it and I prefer brawler raph, but you could go either way.
