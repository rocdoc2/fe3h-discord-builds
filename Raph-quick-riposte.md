## Ultra beefy Raphael

Are you tired of these limp dick dodgetanks and complicated wrath setups? Do you 
long for the years when your units would take hits like MEN, and hit back like GODS.
Here's a build that can take you to the glory days of juiced up juggernauts and big 
mfing stats, and a flavor that's perfect for Raphael. Get quick riposte and just be
so, so much bigger than everyone else. 

This is one of those builds where it's not complicated to get but it's out of line 
with how you normally play this game, so this guide is going to be more about that.

__Class Path__ <br>
Fighter -> Brigand/Archer -> Wyvern/Fortress knight/Warrior -> War Master

__Rank Priorities__ <br>
D Authority -> C heavy armor -> C axes -> D+ bows -> B+ Axes and D flying -> 
B Authority -> B or C+ brawling

If Raph is in house, feel free to pick up D+ swords so he can grab thief bases at 
level 10. It's not necessary but he appreciates it in the short term

You don't have to get B+ axes in time for warrior access. You want the axe rank 
eventually, but you can stop at B there if you like. 

When you're done with that, Consider A+ and S axes, B heavy armor, A authority, and
Wyvern Lord ranks.

__Skill Loadout__
- Quick Riposte
- Axe Prowess
- Hit +20
- HP +5/Axe crit +10/Deatblow/Strength +2/Battalion wrath/Pavise

B. wrath is the least necessay but also the funniest. Having 100% crit when you were
already orkoing is great. 

I kind of hate pavise but Raph gets fortress knight for free and it makes a non-zero
amount of sense here.

__Usage__

Quick riposte is more than just an enemy phase speed boost. Since it makes your 
speed basically infinite, you can use the heaviest weapons and armor available. 
This makes straight up orko'ing via doubling much easier than normal. Additionally,
that heavier armor helps you stay above half health, making quick riposte even 
better. It feeds into itself. The amount of offense you get scales with how bulky 
your unit is.

Therefore, to get the most mileage out of quick riposte, you want to feed Raphael 
every single HP and defense booster. Most builds in this game don't care about 
bulk, so this amount of favoritism isn't as big a deal as you'd think. 
It's basically free outside the one annoying mastery.

Raph also wants the best shield you can get him. The Ochain shield and seiros shield
are preferred, and the silver shield is acceptable if you lack the other two. A high
prt battalion like Fraldarius Soldiers or Duscur Heavy Soliders is also greatly 
appreciated.

Quick riposte isn't very practical. Battalion wrath builds come online quicker and
QR has a noticeably lower power ceiling even at max investment. Still, it's a lot 
of fun and gives you a feel you don't normally get in this game. 10/10, would 
recommend.
